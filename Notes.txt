ASTERIO
=======


The Minotaur has a son, Asterio. 

GOAL
- bring Asterio up appropriately so he turns out okay and loving his father. 
- dying in the process is considered a Bad Thing, and killing the son is a no-no.

Asterio's needs:
- food (from victims)
- entertainment (from warrior victims' toys)
- attention?
- keep health up (goes down by attacks from warriors)

Minotaur's needs:
- keep calm (avoid raging too much)
- food (option: save food for Asterio or eat)
- keep health up (goes down by attacks from warriors)

Rage goes up when attacking anyone. It goes down by being out of sight of enemies.

When rage maxes out, the Minotaur goes into "Frenzy". During this state everyone looks like an enemy, including Asterio. 

Asterio's love:
- goes down every time the Minotaur hits him by accident (during Frenzy)
- goes down while his entertainment or food stats are zero
- goes up every time he is fed

Victims:
- Warriors (rage++, food++, entertainment+)
- Maidens (rage+, food+)
